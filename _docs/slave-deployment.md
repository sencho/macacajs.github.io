title: Slave Deployment
---

Before deploy the `reliable-slave`, there should be a `reliable-master` server running already.

If there wasn't, you should deploy the [`reliable-master`](https://github.com/reliablejs/reliable-master/blob/master/docs/en/deploy.md) first.

After the `reliable-master` server is running, we could use command to deploy `reliable-slave`.
