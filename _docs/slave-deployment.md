title: Slave Deployment

Before deploy the reliable-slave, there should be a reliable-master server running already.

If there wasn't, you should deploy the [master](https://github.com/reliablejs/reliable-master/blob/master/docs/en/deploy.md) first.

After the reliable-master server is running, we could use command to deploy reliable-slave.
