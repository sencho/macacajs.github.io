title: Slave Deployment

Before deploy the [`reliable-macaca-slave`][slave], there should be a [`reliable-master`][master] server running already.

If there wasn't, you should [`deploy the reliable-master`][deploy] first.

After run the `reliable-master` server, we could use command to deploy `reliable-macaca-slave`.
